Anti-Hack - Currently still in development.
=========

Sourcemod-Plugin. Prefer to keep your players instead of banning them?  Use Anti-Hack.

* SMACS imported and modified (GNU GPL v3 copyright headers included)
* SMACS modified for early detections (High Sensitivity Mode)
* optional (sourcebans)
* High Sensitivity Mode (Detect hacking users before the "acutal detection" or detect them trying to "beat SMACS").


Currently still in development.


Plans:

* You will also be able to use Anti-Hack as a way to "filter out" hacking words from your other plugins using it's say & say team forwards.
* Bans players after they type a filtered word more than 3 times (or what ever you set)
* Adds "hackers" to a database to keep track of them after they show they have hacking software
* Optionally crashes hackers whom do certain hacks on your server
*
